                  <p class="w3-medium w3-margin">I was born and raised in Syracuse, NY where I attended Westhill High School. My mom, Vicki, is a child protective services worker and my dad, John, is a lawyer. I have a sister, Dana, who recently graduated from UVM and a brother, David, who attended Syracuse University. I have always loved video games, my dogs, snowboarding, cars, the game of baseball and especially the New York Mets. I played baseball for Westhill until the Varsity level where I was asked to become the assistant JV coach as a student. The only other accolade I collected at Westhill was being elected the President of National Honor Society. Growing up, I was very close with my grandfathers because they were both in the Air Force which fascinated me. My early aspirations included being a commercial pilot or a pilot in the Air Force. However as time went on, I realized I had a passion for the strategical aspect of baseball. Injuries prevented me from ever being effective on the baseball field after JV level competition, so I made up for it by focusing on "off the field" statistics. I had also always enjoyed messing around with electronics and modifying game content to make it more fun for myself. When it came to decision time for college and my future, I had to decide what passion I wanted to follow. I decided to do Computer Science as a major because I figured everyone will always need someone who knows/understands technology, especially with technology adapting as quickly as it has. Having some background in programming from teaching myself, I figured everything was going to be fun and go smoothly. However, upon going to my first 2 months of classes, I realized I didnt want to be a computer scientist anymore. I think its a great hobby to maintain, but for the most part, can be learned on your own time. So, I switched into Economics with the hopes of working in the front office for a sports team. The dream job is to be General Manager (GM) of the New York Mets, but I would be happy working any front office position for any mainstream sports team regardless of the sport. I will continue my studies at the Universty at Buffalo for the next four years, and then plan on possibly attending graduate school elsewhere (I have always wanted to visit UCLA).</p>

          <p>My favorite mountains are Labrador, Stowe, and Sugarbush. I want to work in the snowboard industry eventually. To me there is nothing like riding down the mountain like a wave and having all your worries from that day melt away. I enjoy pushing myself to my limits and trying as many new tricks as possible. I currently ride a GNU Headspace with Union Danny Kass Contact pros for my everyday and my fun/jib board is a Burton Nug with Burton Infidels.</p>

          <p>I own a 2002 Subaru WRX Wagon manual 5 speed, which is considered a "tuner" car. This just means you can add a lot of aftermarket parts to get more performance out of the car. Me and my friends enjoy working on our cars in our free time and I consider it a hobby now. We all own cars that are considered tuner cars and its fun to see where everyones car progresses.</p><hr>

          <p> I have spent some time researching methods that have proven better for pain relief than traditional pain pills within sports. Many athletes become addicted to these pain pills to manage the daily toll on their body and many beneficial substances that don't effect the performance of the athletes have been banned or disallowed until there is further research. I hope to one day be able to change the drug policies in associations such as the NFL, MLB and NBA.</p><hr>

          <p> I have met many talented, "underground" artists the past few years. I really enjoy listening to their music especially because I'm on a personal level with some of the artists who have created this wonderful music for people to enjoy. I try and spread the word about each persons music as I know others will enjoy them as well, which only brings the artist more exposure. I've met the likes of SHIGGY, Rwasenge, and Vaughn Shorter to name a few. I will link their SoundCloud profiles below so you can check them out!</p>
